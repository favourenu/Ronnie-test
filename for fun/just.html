            Hey babe, i just wanna use this opportunity to tell you that i really love you so much, i know
            i
            suck at expressing it
            and sometimes life gets into my head and screw things up a bit but i'm really in love with you babe,
            never felt this way for anybody before all my life and that's why i'm making this little web page just to
            show how much i love you. its a funny way to express oneself i know but this is the best way i got now
            i know you are scared that i'm gonna leave someday but i wanna assure you that i won't , even if i do,
            you
            know
            i will always come back to you
            babe, you are my baby, the love of my life, my angel, my tiger, and the woman of my dreams, i can not
            stay
            away
            from you forever baby, cos i want forever with you babe. No one can ever take your place in my heart baby,
            you are the best and i don't need the rest!.
            I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BABY.
